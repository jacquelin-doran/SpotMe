## Using The Nearby Connections API To Connect Devices Through Bluetooth
### Overview
Nearby Connections at its' heart is a peer-to-peer networking API that provides functionality for discovering, connecting, and exchanging data with nearby devices, all in real-time. Connections using Nearby Connections are high-bandwidth, low-latency, and fully encrypted meaning the connection is fast and secure.

Nearby Connections utilizes a combination of Bluetooth, BLE, and Wifi hotspots, supporting the strengths of each while mitigating their respective weaknesses. What this means is, this platform is performant and broad so that you can focus on the features that matter the most for your implementation.

Nearby Connections can be used to create:
* Collaborative Whiteboard: Create a shared virtual whiteboard for you and nearby participants to work collaboratively.
* Local Multiplayer Gaming: Utilize peer-to-peer connections to play a game that others nearby can join.
* Multi-Screen Gaming: Using your phone or tablet as a game controller and a screen or projector as the game display. Think Kahoot!
* Offline File Transfer: Share photos, videos, or any other type of data quickly and indepentant of a network connection.
